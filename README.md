# Optimization_Case_Study

This repository contains a capaciated lot sizing problem of a door sub-assembly lines in a worldwide home appliance maker's refrigerator factory. The main topic is to determine lot sizes and production sequence for the factory's mixed-models assembly line. A mathematical formulation is discussed and a python script for Gurobi solver is also uploaded.

Thanks are given to my supervisor, Professor Candance Yano, for giving me advice on this study.
